<h3 align="center">Multithreaded Concurrent Swimming Race</h3>


---

<p align="center">This project simulates a Multithreaded Swimming Race, where swimmers compete in a race using threading to manage concurrency. Each swimmer is represented as a thread, and they race across a pool, updating their progress dynamically. The goal of the project is to demonstrate multithreading and concurrency concepts.

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
The simulation of the swim medley enforces strict rules regarding swimmer order, race transitions,
and synchronized starting conditions. Each swim team consists of four swimmers, and they must
swim in a specific sequence according to the medley relay order (Backstroke, Breaststroke,
Butterfly, and Freestyle). The team-based synchronization is designed to ensure that the next
swimmer can only start their section after the previous swimmer has completed theirs.
Additionally, no swimmer can dive into the pool until all team members have reached their starting
blocks, enforcing both fairness and proper race conditions.


The simulation begins when the user presses the Start button.
Swimmers then enter through the entrance door one by one in the order of their swim stoke,
proceed to line up at the starting block, then swim their 100m of the the race as a relay
(swimmers start only after their previous teammate has finished): each swimmer swims to the
end of the 50m pool and back. Once they have finished their 100m, swimmers exit the pool
and stand at the back of the stadium, except for the last member of the team, who stays in the
pool once done.
